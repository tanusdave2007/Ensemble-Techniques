        "\n",
        "Answer 1. Yes, Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) can be effectively used for regression problems. It is known as a Bagging Regressor. It involves training multiple independent base regressors on different bootstrap samples of the training data. The final prediction is then obtained by averaging the predictions from all the individual regressors. This process helps to reduce the variance of the overall model."

Multiple model training, or ensemble learning, trains several base models (e.g., multiple trees) on the data. The goal of single training is to find the best fit from one hypothesis space, while multiple training combines the predictions of many models to achieve a more robust and generally better final result, typically by reducing variance or bias."

It does not look at all available features. This process, controlled by a hyperparameter like $max\\_features$, ensures the individual trees are diverse (decorrelated) and prevents strong features from dominating all trees, which is key to reducing variance and preventing overfitting."

For each base model, the OOB samples are the data points that were not included in its bootstrap training set. The OOB score is calculated by using each data point's OOB models to predict it, and then aggregating these predictions to estimate the model's generalization accuracy, eliminating the need for a separate cross-validation set."

This metric quantifies the average reduction in the objective function (like Gini impurity or MSE) contributed by that feature across all the trees in the forest. A higher mean decrease in impurity indicates a more important feature. Alternatively, the permutation importance method measures the decrease in the model's score when a feature's values are randomly shuffled."

It then trains $N$ independent base classifiers (e.g., Decision Trees) on each of these subsets. For a new data point, each base classifier makes a prediction, and the final prediction is determined by the majority vote among all the classifiers."

It trains multiple base regressors on bootstrap samples of the data. However, instead of using a majority vote for the final output, it computes the average of the predictions made by all the individual base regressors. This averaging process reduces the variance of the overall model's prediction."

The key idea behind ensemble techniques is that a group of \"weak learners\" or base models, when strategically combined, can create a \"strong learner\" that is much better than any single component model. By inducing diversity among the base models and combining their results, the ensemble aims to average out individual model errors and noise, resulting in a more accurate and stable prediction."

        "Answer 16. Bagging reduces overfitting by primarily targeting variance. By training base models on different bootstrap subsets, the models become somewhat independent and diverse. When their predictions are aggregated (via averaging or majority vote), the high variance (sensitivity to the training data) of individual models is smoothed out, leading to a more stable and generalized overall prediction."

        "Answer 17. A Random Forest is generally better than a single Decision Tree because the single tree is prone to overfitting (high variance) the training data by growing to maximum depth. Random Forest averages the predictions of many different, decorrelated trees, which effectively reduces the variance of the model without significantly increasing the bias. This results in superior generalization performance on unseen data."

        "Answer 18. Bootstrap sampling is the process of drawing random samples with replacement from the original training dataset to create multiple training subsets. Its role in Bagging is to create diversity among the base models. Since each subset is slightly different, the base models trained on them will have different error patterns, which is essential for the ensemble to successfully reduce variance when the final predictions are combined."
